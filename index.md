Api-Lib is a backend development platform that simplifies the process of developing and managing APIs. The platform includes a framework, a web interface, and a visual editor to create APIs without coding. Api-Lib takes care of security, authentication, monitoring, management, and caching, among other aspects, making it useful for beginners and experienced developers. The platform also offers a module marketplace where users can create and configure modules without writing code. You can host the API on your own or with Api-Lib. In addition, Api-Lib offers load balancing across multiple server locations, making it easy to distribute the API and handle high traffic volumes.
