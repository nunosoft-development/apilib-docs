title: API-Lib Security Model
description: Learn about API-Lib's comprehensive security model and its features designed to protect your APIs and sensitive data.
---

API-Lib provides a secure platform for developing and managing APIs. Our security model has been developed with the goal of protecting your APIs from unauthorized access and data breaches. Our security features include:

- Operator Isolation
- API Design
- Protection Against Common Attacks
- Use of Deno

In the following sections, we will go into greater detail about each of these security features.

## Operator Isolation

Each API-Lib Operator is designed to run in its own isolated environment using the V8 JavaScript engine. This means that each Operator is executed in a separate process and has its own unique resources, memory space, and context. The isolation ensures that one Operator cannot access the resources or data of another Operator.

### Sandboxed Execution Environment

The V8 JavaScript engine provides a sandboxed execution environment for the JavaScript code. The sandboxed environment prevents an Operator from accessing the file system, network, or other resources on the host machine. Instead, it can only interact with resources that are provided to it through the API-Lib platform. This ensures that an Operator cannot harm the host machine or other Operators.

### Process Isolation

Each Operator runs in its own process, which provides another layer of isolation. This means that if an Operator is compromised, it cannot affect other Operators or processes running on the same machine. It also prevents an attacker from using an Operator to gain access to other parts of the system.

## API Design

API-Lib's APIs are designed to be secure by default. We use HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the client and server. HTTPS provides encryption and authentication for all network communication, which prevents eavesdropping and tampering.

### Authentication and Authorization

API-Lib's API design also includes authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized clients can access the API. We use a variety of authentication methods such as OAuth 2.0, JWT, and Basic Authentication, depending on the needs of the API. Our authorization mechanisms ensure that only users with the appropriate permissions can access specific API resources.

### Rate Limiting

API-Lib's API design includes rate limiting, which helps prevent denial-of-service attacks. Rate limiting allows you to restrict the number of requests that a client can make to your API within a specific time period. This helps prevent overload attacks and ensures that your API can handle a large number of requests without crashing.

## Physical Hardware Separation

For our higher-tier subscriptions and enterprise customers, we offer physical hardware separation as an additional security measure. Physical hardware separation means that the servers used for an individual customer's APIs are physically isolated from the servers used for other customers' APIs. This provides an additional layer of security against data breaches and unauthorized access.

Physical hardware separation ensures that an API-Lib customer's sensitive data is not accessible to any other customers or third parties. This is particularly important for customers with high security requirements or compliance needs.

API-Lib uses a variety of measures to ensure the physical security of the servers, including 24/7 monitoring and surveillance, access control, and regular audits. We also ensure that the servers used for physical hardware separation are located in secure data centers with redundant power and network connectivity.

Physical hardware separation is available as an option for our enterprise customers and for customers with high security requirements. [Contact our sales team](mailto:contact@nunosoft.net) for more information on physical hardware separation and other enterprise-level security options.

## Protection Against Common Attacks

API-Lib is designed to protect against common attacks such as Cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). We use a variety of measures to prevent these attacks.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

API-Lib uses a variety of measures to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. One method we use is input sanitization. Input sanitization is the process of removing or escaping special characters from user input to prevent it from being executed as code. We also use Content Security Policy (CSP), which is a set of HTTP headers that instruct the browser which content sources are allowed to be executed on the page.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is an attack that forces a user to execute unwanted actions on a website that they are currently authenticated to. To protect against CSRF attacks, API-Lib uses a combination of techniques, including CSRF tokens and same-origin policy.

CSRF tokens are unique tokens generated by the server that are included in each HTTP request made by the client. The server validates the token with each request to ensure that the request is valid and was made by an authenticated user. This ensures that even if an attacker tries to force a user to execute a request, the request will be rejected because it does not contain a valid CSRF token.

API-Lib also implements the same-origin policy, which restricts a web page or script from accessing resources from a different origin. This prevents an attacker from making requests on behalf of the user to a different origin.

### Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks

API-Lib uses several methods to prevent Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, which are attacks that attempt to overwhelm a system with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users. We use rate limiting and request throttling to prevent DoS attacks.

Rate limiting restricts the number of requests that a client can make to an API within a specific time period. This ensures that the API can handle a large number of requests without crashing or being overwhelmed by traffic.

Request throttling limits the rate at which requests are processed, which helps prevent a flood of requests from overwhelming the API. This also ensures that the API can handle a large number of requests without crashing or becoming unavailable.

## Use of Deno

API-Lib uses Deno as the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code. Deno is a secure runtime environment that provides a number of security features, including:

- Permission-Based Execution: Deno requires explicit permission to access sensitive resources such as the network, file system, or environment variables. This helps prevent malicious code from accessing sensitive data or resources.

- Secure by Default: Deno enforces strict security policies by default, such as not allowing access to the file system or network by default. This ensures that the code runs in a secure environment, preventing unauthorized access or data breaches.

- Built-in TypeScript Support: Deno natively supports TypeScript, which is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that provides additional security features such as type checking and strict null checks.

## Conclusion

API-Lib's comprehensive security model is designed to protect your APIs and sensitive data from unauthorized access and data breaches. Our security features, including Operator Isolation, API Design, Protection Against Common Attacks, and use of Deno, provide multiple layers of security to ensure that your APIs remain secure and available to authorized clients. By leveraging our secure backend development platform, you can focus on building your APIs and trust that your data is safe and secure.
