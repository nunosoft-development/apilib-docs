API-Lib is a backend development platform that provides a comprehensive set of tools and features to help you create, manage, and secure APIs. On this Page, we will provide a detailed overview of how Operators and API-Lib work.

## Overview of API-Lib

API-Lib is built using the Deno runtime environment and the V8 JavaScript engine.

## How Operators Work

Operators are the request handlers in API-Lib. They receive incoming requests, process them, and return a response. Operators are written in JavaScript (or TypeScript) and run in their own isolated environment using the V8 JavaScript engine.

### Isolation

As we mentioned earlier, Operators run in their own isolated environment, which provides a high level of security and protection. [Click here to get more information about our Security Model.](https://docs.api-lib.com/learning/security) Each Operator runs in a separate process and has its own unique resources and memory space. This means that if an Operator is compromised, it cannot affect other Operators or processes running on the same machine.

### Request Processing

When a request is received, API-Lib first determines which Operator should handle the request. This is done using a routing table, which maps incoming requests to the appropriate Operator. Once the appropriate Operator is determined, API-Lib executes the Operator in its own isolated environment using the V8 JavaScript engine.

The Operator then processes the request, which can include parsing the request data, executing business logic, and interacting with databases or other external resources. Once the Operator has completed its processing, it returns a response, which API-Lib sends back to the client.

## How API-Lib Works

API-Lib provides a platform for developers to create and manage APIs. The platform includes a set of tools and libraries that help developers create secure, performant, and scalable APIs.

### Request Handling

API-Lib uses a multi-process architecture to handle incoming requests. This means that requests are handled by multiple processes running on different CPUs or cores. This approach improves performance and scalability by distributing the workload across multiple processes.

API-Lib also includes a built-in load balancer, which distributes incoming requests across the available processes. The load balancer uses a variety of algorithms to distribute requests evenly across the processes, ensuring that no single process becomes overloaded.

### Performance Optimization

API-Lib is designed to be highly performant. To achieve this, API-Lib uses a variety of performance optimization techniques, including:

#### Caching

API-Lib includes a built-in caching system, which caches frequently accessed data to improve performance. The caching system uses a variety of algorithms to determine which data should be cached and for how long.

#### Compression

API-Lib supports data compression, which reduces the size of the data sent over the network. This can significantly improve performance, especially for APIs that transmit large amounts of data.

#### Connection Pooling

API-Lib uses connection pooling to improve performance when interacting with databases or other external resources. Connection pooling allows API-Lib to reuse existing database connections instead of creating new ones for each request.

### Security

API-Lib includes a comprehensive set of security features, which are designed to protect your APIs and sensitive data. These features include:

#### Operator Isolation

As we discussed earlier, each Operator runs in its own isolated environment, which provides a high level of security and protection.

#### HTTPS Encryption

API-Lib uses HTTPS to encrypt all communication between the client and server. HTTPS provides encryption and authentication for all network communication, which prevents eavesdropping and tampering.

#### Input Validation and Sanitization

API-Lib provides tools for input validation and sanitization, which help prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

### API Design

API-Lib provides a variety of tools and libraries to help developers design APIs that are easy to use, consistent, and scalable. These tools include:

#### Validation

API-Lib includes support for JSON Schema, which allows you to define the structure and constraints of your API requests and responses. This ensures that your API data is consistent and valid.

#### Middleware

API-Lib includes a middleware system, which allows you to add functionality to your APIs without modifying your Operators directly. Middleware can handle tasks such as authentication, logging, and error handling.
